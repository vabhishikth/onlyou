# User Flow

## Phase 1: Download & First Open

You download the app from the Play Store or App Store. When you open it for the first time, you see a clean, calm screen — soft blues and greens, not the typical clinical white-coat-stethoscope vibe. Think of how Hims looks lifestyle-focused, like a wellness brand, not a hospital.

The first screen asks you one question: **"What brought you here?"**

Three big tappable cards appear:

- 🏋️ **Weight Management** (GLP-1 program)
- 👨 **Men's Health** (ED/Testosterone)
- 👩 **Women's Health** (PCOS/Menopause)

You tap one. Let's say you tap **Weight Management** because you've been trying to lose weight and heard about Ozempic/Semaglutide.

---

## Phase 2: Account Creation (2 minutes)

The app asks for your **phone number**. You type it in, receive an OTP on WhatsApp or SMS, enter it, and you're in. That's it — no email required, no password to remember. Phone number is your identity because that's how India works.

Next, it asks for your **name, age, gender**. Optional: link your ABHA ID (the government health ID — like an Aadhaar for health records). If you have one, the app can pull your existing medical history from other hospitals you've visited. If you don't, no problem, you skip it.

---

## Phase 3: The Medical Intake Questionnaire (10–20 minutes)

This is the most important part and it's designed to feel like a conversation, not a hospital form.

One question per screen. Big buttons. No tiny text fields.

For the weight management vertical, the questions go something like:

**Screen 1:** "What's your current weight?" → You type or use a slider
**Screen 2:** "What's your height?" → The app instantly calculates your BMI and shows it
**Screen 3:** "Have you tried losing weight before?" → Yes/No buttons
**Screen 4:** "Which methods have you tried?" → Checkboxes: Diet, Exercise, Medication, Surgery, None
**Screen 5:** "Do you have any of these conditions?" → Diabetes, Heart disease, Thyroid issues, None
**Screen 6:** "Are you currently taking any medications?" → Free text or "None"
**Screen 7:** "Do you have a history of pancreatitis or thyroid cancer?" → This is a critical safety question because GLP-1 drugs are contraindicated for these
**Screen 8–15:** More questions about blood pressure, eating habits, exercise levels, sleep, mental health screening, family history...
**Screen 16:** "Please upload a government ID" → You take a photo of your Aadhaar/PAN/Driving License
**Screen 17:** "Please take a selfie" → The app verifies your face matches the ID

**While you're doing all of this, something important is happening in the background:**

The AI triage system is reading your answers in real-time. It's building a clinical summary for the doctor. If you answer "yes" to chest pain or suicidal thoughts, it immediately stops the questionnaire and shows emergency numbers (112, 108 ambulance). If you mention pancreatitis history, it flags this as a contraindication for GLP-1 drugs. If everything looks normal, it creates a neat summary like: *"32F, BMI 33, no cardiac history, previous failed diet attempts, no contraindications identified, suitable candidate for GLP-1 consultation."*

The doctor will see this summary before they even meet you.

---

## Phase 4: Choose Your Plan & Pay (2 minutes)

After completing the questionnaire, the app shows you subscription options:

- **Monthly:** ₹2,999/month
- **Quarterly:** ₹2,499/month (billed ₹7,497)
- **6-month:** ₹1,999/month (billed ₹11,994)

You pick one. Razorpay opens. You pay via UPI (tap GPay/PhonePe), card, or net banking. If you chose monthly, UPI AutoPay is set up so next month's payment happens automatically — you don't have to remember.

The moment payment clears, the system does three things simultaneously:

1. Puts you in the **doctor queue**
2. Matches you with an appropriate doctor (endocrinologist for weight management)
3. Shows you available appointment slots

---

## Phase 5: Video Consultation with Doctor (15–30 minutes)

You pick a slot — say tomorrow at 7 PM. You get a WhatsApp reminder 24 hours before and 1 hour before.

At 6:55 PM, you open the app. It shows a "Your appointment starts in 5 minutes" countdown. At 6:58, a "Test Camera & Mic" button appears — you tap it, see yourself, confirm audio works.

At 7:00 PM, the doctor joins. On your screen, you see the doctor's video. On the **doctor's screen** (which you can't see), they have a split view:

- Your video on the left
- Your complete medical file on the right — the AI summary, your questionnaire answers, your BMI, your flagged risks, everything. They don't need to ask you to repeat anything you already typed.

The doctor reviews your case, asks follow-up questions, explains how Semaglutide works, discusses side effects (nausea, especially in the first few weeks), and decides you're a good candidate.

**This video call is mandatory by Indian law** for Schedule H drugs (which Semaglutide is). The system literally cannot generate a prescription without a completed video session — it's hardcoded, not a setting anyone can toggle off.

The doctor might also order **blood tests** — a metabolic panel (fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, liver function, kidney function, thyroid). These appear instantly in your app.

---

## Phase 6: Lab Tests / Blood Work (1–3 days)

Now you have two options depending on your city:

**Option A — Nurse comes to you (Assisted Telemedicine):**
The app shows "A nurse visit has been scheduled." You see the nurse's name, photo, and a time slot. The next morning, Priya (your assigned nurse) shows up at your home.

Her phone app guides her through every step:

1. She checks in via GPS (the system timestamps her arrival)
2. She takes your vitals — weight, blood pressure, pulse, blood oxygen
3. She collects blood samples following a checklist — verifies your identity, confirms you're fasting, draws blood, labels tubes with barcodes, photographs them, logs the temperature of the cold pack
4. All this data streams to the doctor's dashboard in real-time

The blood samples go to a partner lab via courier. Results come back in 24–48 hours and automatically appear in your app AND the doctor's dashboard.

**Option B — You visit a partner lab:**
The app shows nearby partner labs on a map. You walk in, show the QR code from your app, they draw blood. Results flow back the same way.

---

## Phase 7: Doctor Reviews Results & Writes Prescription

The doctor gets a notification: "Lab results ready for Patient [You]."

They open their dashboard, see your blood work alongside the AI's analysis: *"All values within normal range. No contraindications for Semaglutide initiation. Recommended starting dose: 0.25mg weekly for 4 weeks."*

The doctor uses the **Smart Prescription Pad** — instead of typing everything from scratch, they select the "GLP-1 Initiation" template which pre-fills:

- Semaglutide 0.25mg subcutaneous injection, once weekly × 4 weeks
- Then escalate to 0.5mg × 4 weeks
- Then 1mg maintenance
- Plus: Metformin 500mg if your blood sugar was borderline
- Plus: Lab recheck in 3 months

Every medication has its SNOMED-CT code automatically attached (for government health record compliance). All drug names are generic (required by law — the app literally blocks brand names).

The doctor signs digitally. The moment they sign:

1. A PDF is generated with all legally required fields (doctor name, registration number, your details, diagnosis, medications, dosage, QR code)
2. The PDF is hashed (a mathematical fingerprint is created)
3. The PDF is uploaded to tamper-proof storage where it **cannot be modified by anyone** — not even the doctor, not even an admin — for minimum 3 years
4. The prescription appears in your app within seconds

---

## Phase 8: First Injection — Nurse Visit (This is the Competitive Moat)

Because Semaglutide is an **injectable**, you can't just pop a pill. Someone needs to show you how to inject yourself, or better yet, do it for you the first time.

Priya the nurse is scheduled again. She arrives at your home. But this time, something different happens:

She taps "Start Assisted Consultation" on her phone. Your doctor gets a push notification and joins a **three-way video call** — the doctor on their laptop, and you + Priya on her phone camera. The doctor can see Priya's camera feed plus your vitals on a side panel.

The doctor confirms: "Go ahead with the first dose."

Priya administers the injection. Then she **must** complete a "Proof of Administration":

- Takes a timestamped, GPS-tagged photo
- Signs a digital affidavit
- Records your post-injection vitals (blood pressure, pulse, any immediate reactions)

**Why this matters:** The system will NOT unlock your next month's prescription refill until this Proof of Administration is verified. This is a legal requirement for injectables in India, and it's enforced by the software — no human can bypass it.

---

## Phase 9: Medication Delivery

Meanwhile, the prescription has been routed to a **partner pharmacy**. The pharmacy dashboard shows the incoming order. The pharmacist accepts it, picks the medication from cold storage (Semaglutide must stay at 2–8°C), packs it with a temperature logger, and hands it to the cold chain courier.

You get WhatsApp notifications:

- "Your prescription has been confirmed by PharmaCare Pharmacy"
- "Your medication has been shipped — track here"
- "Your medication is arriving today — please refrigerate immediately upon delivery"

A Bluetooth temperature logger on the package tracks the temperature throughout transit. If it ever goes above 8°C, the system flags it and the pharmacist must confirm the medication is still viable.

The medication arrives at your door in a discreet box (no "WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATION" printed on it) within 24 hours in metro cities, 48 hours in Tier 2 cities.

---

## Phase 10: Your Daily/Weekly Life on the Platform

Now you're an active patient. Here's what your app looks like day to day:

**Home screen:**

- A ring showing your medication adherence (did you take your weekly injection? did you log it?)
- Weight trend chart (you log weight weekly)
- Upcoming appointments
- Next injection date countdown

**Weekly:**

- The app reminds you via push notification and WhatsApp: "Time for your Semaglutide injection"
- You self-inject (after Priya showed you how), log it in the app
- You weigh yourself and log it

**Monthly:**

- You have a follow-up video call with the doctor (shorter this time, 10 minutes)
- Doctor reviews your weight trend, asks about side effects
- If everything's good, the prescription renews automatically
- If there are concerns, they adjust the dosage or add medications

**Every 3 months:**

- Nurse visit for blood work again (monitoring liver, kidney, metabolic markers)
- Doctor reviews and adjusts the treatment plan
- Your dose might escalate from 0.25mg → 0.5mg → 1mg as per protocol

**Chat tab:**

- Anytime you have a question — "I'm feeling nauseous, is that normal?" — you message your care team through the in-app chat. A care coordinator responds first for basic questions, and escalates to the doctor if needed.

---

## Phase 11: Subscription Auto-Renews

On the billing date, Razorpay auto-charges via UPI AutoPay. You get a receipt via WhatsApp and email. If the payment fails, you get reminders. If you want to pause (going on vacation, for example), you can pause for up to 30 days from the Profile tab.

If you want to cancel, there's a clear cancel flow — no hidden hoops. But the app will remind you of your progress: "You've lost 8.2 kg in 3 months. Are you sure?"

---

## Phase 12: What Happens Behind the Scenes (Admin Side)

While all of this feels smooth to you, the **admin operations dashboard** is buzzing:

- An admin sees the complete pipeline: how many patients are at each stage (intake, awaiting labs, active treatment, follow-up due)
- If a doctor's consultation was unusually short (say 3 minutes instead of 15), the AI flags it and the Medical Director reviews it
- If a pharmacy is consistently slow, SLA tracking catches it
- Revenue dashboards show monthly recurring revenue, churn rate, and revenue per vertical
- Compliance audit logs record every data access — who viewed what patient record, when, from where

---

## The Entire Flow in One Line

**Download → Pick vertical → Answer health questions (AI analyzes) → Pay subscription → Video call with doctor (legally required) → Blood tests (nurse comes to you) → Doctor reviews + prescribes (tamper-proof) → Nurse administers first injection (proof required) → Medication delivered cold-chain → Monthly follow-ups → Auto-renewing subscription → Continuous monitoring**

The magic is that it feels like a consumer wellness app to you, but underneath it's a fully compliant clinical operating system with immutable prescriptions, mandatory video sessions, proof of drug administration, and government health record integration.

## Vertical 1: GLP-1 Weight Loss (already covered above)

Quick recap of what's unique to this one:

- **Medications:** Semaglutide (injectable, weekly), possibly Metformin (oral, daily)
- **Key constraint:** Injectable = nurse visit mandatory for first dose + Proof of Administration
- **Lab cycle:** Every 3 months (metabolic panel, liver, kidney)
- **Cold chain:** Yes — Semaglutide must stay 2–8°C throughout shipping
- **Typical patient:** 25–45 year old, BMI 28+, has tried diet/exercise and failed
- **Success metric they care about:** Weight in kg dropping on the chart
- **Subscription duration:** Usually 6–12 months, sometimes ongoing maintenance

---

## Vertical 2: Men's Health — TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy)

### Who is this patient?

Rahul, 38, software engineer in Bangalore. He's been feeling exhausted for months, his gym performance has dropped, his libido is low, he's irritable, and he's gaining belly fat despite working out. He Googled "low testosterone symptoms" and found your app.

### The Intake Questionnaire (Different from Weight Loss)

After selecting "Men's Health" and creating his account, the questionnaire branches differently:

**Screen 1:** "What's bothering you most?" → Checkboxes: Low energy, Low sex drive, Erectile difficulty, Mood changes, Muscle loss, Weight gain, Poor sleep, Brain fog
**Screen 2:** "How long have you been experiencing this?" → Less than 3 months / 3–6 months / 6–12 months / Over a year
**Screen 3:** "Rate your energy levels on a typical day" → Slider 1–10
**Screen 4:** "How often do you experience morning erections?" → This is actually a clinical indicator for testosterone levels
**Screen 5:** "Do you have any of these conditions?" → Prostate cancer, sleep apnea, blood clotting disorders, polycythemia (high red blood cell count) — these are **hard contraindications** for TRT. If he checks prostate cancer, the flow STOPS and routes him to an oncologist instead.
**Screen 6:** "Are you planning to have children in the next 1–2 years?" → **This is critical.** TRT can suppress sperm production and cause infertility. If he says yes, the doctor needs to discuss alternatives like Clomiphene or HCG instead of testosterone.
**Screen 7–12:** Medication history, mental health screening (depression is common with low T and needs separate treatment), lifestyle questions, substance use (anabolic steroids history matters a lot here), ID verification + selfie

**The AI triage flags differently here.** Instead of looking for pancreatitis risk (weight loss vertical), it's looking for: prostate cancer history, severe sleep apnea, fertility concerns, signs of depression that need separate treatment, and any history of steroid abuse.

### The Lab Work (More Extensive Than Weight Loss)

Before the doctor can even consider prescribing TRT, they need bloodwork. This is **non-negotiable** — you cannot prescribe testosterone without baseline hormone levels.

The nurse visit or lab visit includes:

- **Total Testosterone** (must be drawn before 10 AM — testosterone peaks in the morning, so afternoon levels give falsely low readings. The app enforces this by only offering morning appointment slots for initial TRT labs.)
- **Free Testosterone**
- **SHBG** (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin)
- **LH and FSH** (Luteinizing Hormone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone — these tell the doctor WHETHER the problem is in the brain or the testes)
- **Estradiol** (yes, men have estrogen too — and on TRT it can spike, causing breast tissue growth)
- **Prolactin** (high levels can indicate a pituitary tumor causing the low T)
- **CBC** (Complete Blood Count — TRT increases red blood cells, so baseline is essential)
- **PSA** (Prostate Specific Antigen — baseline before starting TRT)
- **Lipid Panel** (cholesterol — TRT affects it)
- **Liver Function Tests**
- **Thyroid Panel** (thyroid issues mimic low-T symptoms)

This is 12+ individual tests. The "TRT Hormone Panel" Smart Set auto-orders all of them with one tap on the doctor's dashboard.

### The Doctor Consultation

The doctor sees the AI summary plus lab results. Let's say Rahul's total testosterone comes back at 280 ng/dL (normal is 300–1000). His Free T is low, LH is high (meaning his testes are failing to respond to brain signals), and everything else is normal.

The doctor's decision tree:

1. **Is the T level actually low?** If borderline (250–350), the doctor might retest before committing to TRT
2. **What's the cause?** High LH = primary hypogonadism (testes problem). Low LH = secondary (brain/pituitary problem — may need MRI)
3. **Fertility concern?** If yes → Clomiphene (oral, stimulates natural T production, preserves fertility). If no → Testosterone
4. **Which form of testosterone?** For a telemedicine platform with nurse visits, **Testosterone Undecanoate injection** (given every 10–14 weeks) is ideal because it requires fewer injections than weekly testosterone cypionate

### The Prescription & Injection Cycle (Very Different from Weight Loss)

The doctor prescribes Testosterone Undecanoate 1000mg intramuscular injection. This is a **deep intramuscular injection into the gluteus** — patients should NOT self-inject this. It must be administered by a healthcare professional.

Here's where the flow diverges massively from the weight loss vertical:

**Injection 1 (Day 0):** Nurse visit at Rahul's home. Same three-way video bridge with the doctor. Nurse administers the injection. Proof of Administration captured (photo, signature, post-injection vitals, 30-minute observation for rare allergic reaction). The system records this.

**Injection 2 (Week 6):** Second loading dose. Nurse visit again. Same Proof of Administration process.

**Injection 3 onwards (Every 10–14 weeks):** Maintenance dose. Nurse visit each time.

Unlike Semaglutide (where the patient learns to self-inject weekly), **TRT patients on Undecanoate need a nurse visit every single injection cycle**. This means ~5 nurse visits per year per TRT patient. This is a significant operational cost but also a competitive moat — no other Indian telehealth app offers this.

### Monitoring (Ongoing — Different Schedule from Weight Loss)

**At 3 months:** Repeat bloodwork — Total T, Free T, Estradiol, CBC, PSA, Liver. The doctor is checking:

- Is the testosterone now in the 450–700 range? If too low, dose adjustment. If too high (>900), reduce frequency.
- Has Estradiol spiked? If yes, may need an aromatase inhibitor (Anastrozole) to block testosterone converting to estrogen
- Has CBC shown polycythemia (red blood cells too high)? This is the most common side effect of TRT. If hematocrit exceeds 54%, TRT must be paused and the patient needs to donate blood

**At 6 months:** Full panel recheck including PSA (prostate monitoring)

**Annually:** Complete reassessment including mental health screening

### What the Patient Sees in the App (Different Home Screen)

- **Testosterone level trend chart** (instead of weight chart)
- **Next injection countdown** (e.g., "Next injection in 18 days")
- **Symptom tracker:** Weekly check-in where Rahul rates his energy, libido, mood, gym performance on sliders. This creates a graph the doctor uses to assess treatment effectiveness
- **Medication adherence:** Not daily (like pills) but per-cycle — "Injection #3 ✅ completed March 15"

---

## Vertical 3: Men's Health — ED (Erectile Dysfunction)

### Who is this patient?

Amit, 42, runs a restaurant in Mumbai. He's embarrassed about this — which is exactly why an app is better than walking into a clinic. He found your app at 11 PM while searching on his phone.

### The Key Difference: This Can Be Mostly Async

Unlike TRT (which needs injections) and GLP-1 (which needs injections), ED medications are **oral pills** — Tadalafil or Sildenafil. No nurse visit needed for administration. No cold chain. No Proof of Administration.

This makes it the **simplest and highest-margin vertical** because the operational cost is lowest while the subscription revenue is recurring.

### The Intake Questionnaire

**Screen 1:** "How often do you experience difficulty with erections?" → Always / Most times / Sometimes / Rarely
**Screen 2:** "When did this start?" → Timeline
**Screen 3:** "Can you achieve erections during masturbation or morning erections?" → This differentiates between physical and psychological causes. If yes to masturbation but no during sex, likely psychological. If no to both, likely physical.
**Screen 4:** "Do you have any heart conditions?" → **Critical.** Sildenafil/Tadalafil interact dangerously with nitrate medications (nitroglycerin for chest pain). The AI flags this as an absolute contraindication.
**Screen 5:** "Are you taking any nitrate medications?" → If yes, the flow blocks ED medication prescribing entirely and routes to a cardiologist
**Screen 6:** "Do you take blood pressure medications?" → Important for dose adjustment
**Screen 7:** "Do you use recreational drugs?" → Poppers (amyl nitrite) + Sildenafil = potentially fatal blood pressure drop
**Screen 8:** "How would you describe your stress levels?" → ED is often stress/anxiety related
**Screen 9:** Mental health and relationship screening
**Screen 10:** Blood pressure measurement (the app might ask them to use a home BP monitor or visit a pharmacy)

### The Consultation — Can Be Faster

The video call for ED is typically 10–15 minutes (shorter than TRT or weight loss) because:

- No complex lab interpretation needed (basic labs may be ordered but aren't always required for straightforward cases)
- The treatment options are well-established
- The doctor is primarily ruling out cardiac risk and nitrate interactions

The doctor prescribes one of:

**Tadalafil 5mg daily** (the "daily" option — works continuously, more natural, preferred by most patients) — SNOMED-CT: 407111005
OR
**Sildenafil 50mg as-needed** (the "on-demand" option — take 30–60 minutes before activity) — SNOMED-CT: 372572000

### No Nurse Visit, No Cold Chain, No Proof of Administration

The prescription goes straight to the pharmacy. The medication is regular pills — room temperature storage, standard shipping, discreet packaging. Delivered by Shiprocket/Delhivery like any e-commerce order. Often arrives the next day.

**This is why ED is the fastest vertical from signup to medication-in-hand.** A patient could theoretically download the app at 11 PM, complete the questionnaire, have a video call the next morning, and receive medication by evening. Total: ~24 hours.

### Ongoing Monitoring

**Monthly:** Quick check-in via in-app chat or short video follow-up. How's it working? Any side effects (headaches, flushing, nasal congestion are common with Sildenafil)? Dose adjustment needed?

**Every 6 months:** Blood pressure check, basic bloodwork (if the doctor ordered it initially)

**The app home screen for ED patients:**

- Medication adherence tracker (daily pill reminder for Tadalafil, or usage log for as-needed Sildenafil)
- Next refill date
- Symptom check-in (less frequent than TRT — maybe monthly)
- Chat with care team

---

## Vertical 4: Women's Health — PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)

### Who is this patient?

Sneha, 27, marketing manager in Hyderabad. Her periods have been irregular for the past year (coming every 40–60 days instead of 28–30). She's noticed acne getting worse, some facial hair growth, and she's gained 7 kg without changing her diet. She's frustrated and her local gynecologist brushed it off as "stress."

### The Intake Questionnaire (Most Complex of All Verticals)

PCOS is a syndrome (multiple symptoms, no single cause), so the questionnaire is the longest and most branching:

**Menstrual history block:**

- When was your last period?
- How many periods have you had in the last 12 months? (fewer than 8 = oligomenorrhea, a PCOS hallmark)
- How heavy are your periods? Light / Normal / Heavy / Very heavy with clots
- Any pain? Scale 1–10
- Age of first period?
- Have your periods always been irregular, or did this start recently?

**PCOS symptom block:**

- Acne: Where? Face / Back / Chest. Severity?
- Excess hair growth: Chin / Upper lip / Chest / Abdomen / Back (this is called hirsutism — scored on the Ferriman-Gallwey scale)
- Hair thinning on scalp?
- Skin darkening in neck/armpit folds? (acanthosis nigricans — insulin resistance marker)
- Weight gain pattern? (PCOS weight typically accumulates around the abdomen)

**Metabolic block:**

- Family history of diabetes?
- Do you feel excessively thirsty/frequent urination? (diabetes screening)
- Energy levels?
- Mood changes / anxiety / depression?

**Fertility block (this shapes the entire treatment approach):**

- Are you currently trying to conceive? → If YES, treatment is completely different (Letrozole for ovulation induction, no Metformin in some cases)
- Do you plan to conceive in the next 12 months?
- Are you currently using contraception? Which type?

**Safety block:**

- Any history of blood clots? (relevant if oral contraceptives are considered)
- Kidney or liver problems? (relevant for Metformin)
- Pregnancy test: "Is there any chance you could be pregnant right now?" → Metformin and Letrozole are handled differently in pregnancy

### The Lab Work (Different Panel from Men's Health)

The "PCOS Hormone Panel" Smart Set orders:

- **Total Testosterone and Free Testosterone** (yes, women have testosterone too — it's often elevated in PCOS)
- **DHEA-S** (adrenal androgen — differentiates PCOS from adrenal disorders)
- **17-Hydroxyprogesterone** (rules out Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, which mimics PCOS)
- **LH and FSH** (LH:FSH ratio > 2:1 is a classic PCOS finding)
- **Estradiol and Progesterone** (day 21 of cycle if possible, to check ovulation)
- **Prolactin** (rules out pituitary issues)
- **Thyroid Panel (TSH, T3, T4)** (thyroid problems mimic PCOS symptoms)
- **Fasting Glucose + Fasting Insulin** (insulin resistance is the metabolic engine of PCOS)
- **HbA1c** (3-month blood sugar average)
- **Lipid Panel**
- **AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone)** — elevated in PCOS, and also tells the doctor about ovarian reserve if fertility is a concern

This is 15+ individual tests. The nurse draws blood during the home visit, ideally on **Day 2–5 of the menstrual cycle** (when hormone levels are at baseline). The app tracks the patient's cycle and schedules the nurse visit accordingly — this is something a non-specialized platform would miss.

### Ultrasound — The One Thing the App Can't Do

The doctor will likely order a **pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound** to look for polycystic ovaries (the "string of pearls" appearance — 12+ follicles on each ovary).

This cannot be done at home. The app shows a map of partner radiology centers near Sneha. She books through the app, visits the center, and the ultrasound report (with images) gets uploaded to the lab partner dashboard and pushed to her file automatically.

This is the only step in any vertical that requires the patient to physically go somewhere, and only for PCOS/women's health.

### The Diagnosis (AI-Assisted but Doctor-Decided)

PCOS is diagnosed using the **Rotterdam Criteria** — you need 2 out of 3:

1. Irregular/absent periods (oligo/anovulation)
2. Clinical or biochemical signs of excess androgens (acne, hirsutism, or elevated testosterone on bloodwork)
3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound

The AI pre-checks the Rotterdam criteria against Sneha's data and presents it to the doctor: *"Patient meets 3/3 Rotterdam criteria. Elevated free testosterone (58 ng/dL), oligomenorrhea (6 cycles in 12 months), polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound. HOMA-IR suggests insulin resistance. No fertility concern at this time."*

### The Prescription (Multi-Drug, Lifestyle-Heavy)

PCOS treatment is NOT just one pill. The "PCOS Metabolic Set" Smart Set includes:

**If NOT trying to conceive:**

- **Metformin 500mg** → start low, build to 1500mg over 4–6 weeks (to reduce side effects like nausea/diarrhea). SNOMED-CT: 372567009. Addresses insulin resistance, which is the root metabolic driver.
- **Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill** (e.g., containing drospirenone) — to regulate periods and reduce androgens. This is prescribed by the gynecologist, not auto-filled by the app (it requires clinical judgment about clot risk).
- **Spironolactone 50–100mg** — anti-androgen for acne and hirsutism (takes 3–6 months to show results on hair/skin)

**If trying to conceive:**

- **Letrozole 2.5–5mg** (days 3–7 of cycle) — ovulation induction drug. SNOMED-CT: 386911004. This replaces Clomiphene as first-line for PCOS fertility treatment per current guidelines.
- **Metformin** — still used for insulin resistance
- **NO spironolactone** (it's a teratogen — causes birth defects)
- Possibly referral to a fertility specialist if Letrozole doesn't work in 3–6 cycles

**Lifestyle prescription (equally important, built into the Smart Set):**

- Diet plan: Low-GI, Mediterranean-style, reducing refined carbs (the app could integrate with a nutrition module in future)
- Exercise: 150 minutes/week moderate intensity
- Weight loss target: Even 5–10% body weight loss can restore ovulation in PCOS

All these are oral medications — **no injections, no nurse visit for administration, no Proof of Administration needed.** The medications ship via standard courier in discreet packaging.

### Ongoing Monitoring (Most Complex of All Verticals)

**Monthly for first 3 months:** Video follow-up to check Metformin tolerance (GI side effects are common and the main reason patients quit), monitor period regularity, and track symptoms.

**The app home screen for PCOS patients:**

- **Period tracker** (log dates, flow, symptoms — the app shows whether cycles are becoming more regular over time)
- **Symptom diary:** Acne severity, hirsutism progression (photo comparison over months), mood, energy
- **Weight trend** (if overweight — PCOS and weight are deeply linked)
- **Medication reminders:** Daily for Metformin, cyclical for OCP
- **Glucose/insulin tracker** (if monitoring at home)

**Every 3 months:** Repeat fasting glucose, fasting insulin, testosterone, lipid panel. The doctor checks whether insulin resistance is improving and androgens are dropping.

**Every 6 months:** Full panel recheck. If trying to conceive, monitoring ovulation with LH strips (the app reminds when to test).

---

## Vertical 5: Women's Health — Menopause/Perimenopause

### Who is this patient?

Kavita, 49, school principal in Pune. Hot flashes are disrupting her sleep, she's had night sweats for months, mood swings are affecting her work, vaginal dryness is impacting her relationship, and she's anxious about bone density (her mother had osteoporosis).

### How It Differs

The intake questionnaire focuses on: **menopausal symptoms inventory** (hot flashes frequency/severity, night sweats, sleep quality, mood, vaginal dryness, joint pain, brain fog, urinary symptoms), **menstrual status** (when was last period — perimenopause = still having periods but irregular, menopause = no period for 12+ months), **risk assessment** for Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) — history of breast cancer, blood clots, stroke, liver disease, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.

**Labs are different:** FSH (elevated = ovarian function declining), Estradiol (low = menopause), thyroid panel, lipid panel, Vitamin D, calcium, DEXA scan referral (bone density — like the ultrasound, this requires a physical visit to a partner radiology center).

**Treatment is HRT-centric:**

- **Estradiol patches or tablets** — SNOMED-CT: 126098001
- **Progesterone** (if the patient still has a uterus — estrogen alone without progesterone increases uterine cancer risk)
- **Vaginal estrogen cream** (for localized symptoms)
- Calcium + Vitamin D supplementation
- Possibly bisphosphonates if bone density is low

All oral/topical — no injections, no nurse administration needed. Standard shipping.

**Monitoring:** Every 3–6 months to adjust HRT dosage based on symptom resolution and side effects. Annual mammogram referral (HRT slightly increases breast cancer risk — the app reminds and helps schedule through partner imaging centers).

## How the App Handles Multiple Verticals Simultaneously

Here's something the blueprint accounts for: **patients can be in multiple verticals.**

Rahul (38, low T) might ALSO have weight issues (low testosterone causes weight gain). The system lets the doctor add the GLP-1 vertical to his treatment plan alongside TRT. His home screen then shows BOTH:

- Testosterone trend chart + next injection countdown
- Weight trend chart + weekly Semaglutide reminder

The doctor dashboard shows his unified patient record — all medications across all verticals in one view, with the drug interaction checker running across everything (does his TRT interact with his GLP-1? In this case, no — but the system checks).

## The Revenue Difference Across Verticals

This matters for your business:

| Vertical | Subscription Price | Nurse Visits/Year | Medication Cost | Margin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ED** | ₹999–1,999/mo | **0** (pills only) | Low (generics cheap) | **Highest** |
| **GLP-1** | ₹2,999–4,999/mo | 4–6 (initial + quarterly) | High (Semaglutide is expensive) | Medium |
| **TRT** | ₹1,999–3,499/mo | 5+ (every injection) | Medium | Lower (nurse cost) |
| **PCOS** | ₹999–1,999/mo | 2–4 (lab visits) | Low (generics) | **High** |
| **Menopause** | ₹999–1,999/mo | 1–2 (lab visits) | Medium (HRT patches) | High |

**ED is your cash cow** — lowest operational cost, high subscription revenue, massive market (estimated 50M+ Indian men affected, extreme stigma keeping them from clinics = perfect for an app).

**GLP-1 is your premium tier** — highest price point but also highest cost due to cold chain + expensive medication + frequent nurse visits.

**PCOS is your growth engine** — huge underserved market (1 in 5 Indian women), moderate pricing, low operational cost, but patients stay for years (PCOS is a lifelong condition).

That's the complete picture across every vertical. The infrastructure is shared — same app, same doctor dashboard, same nurse app, same pharmacy pipeline — but the questionnaires, lab panels, prescription templates, monitoring schedules, and nurse visit requirements all branch based on which vertical the patient is in.
