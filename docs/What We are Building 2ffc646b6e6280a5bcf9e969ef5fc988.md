# What We are Building

## What are we building?

Think of it this way. Right now in India, if you have a problem like hair loss, weight gain, sexual health issues, PCOS, or hormonal imbalances — you're on your own. You Google your symptoms, maybe visit a doctor once, get a prescription, buy medicines from a pharmacy, and then... nobody follows up. Nobody checks if the treatment is working. Nobody adjusts your dose. You're basically guessing your way through your own healthcare.

We're building the opposite of that.

We're building a platform where you open your phone, tell us what's bothering you, get connected to a real licensed doctor within minutes, receive a personalized treatment plan, and then — here's the key part — **your medicines show up at your door every month, automatically, in beautiful discreet packaging, and your doctor keeps monitoring you the entire time.** If something isn't working, they adjust it. If you need lab tests, we arrange them. If you want to add weight management to your hair loss treatment, it's one tap away.

It's not a doctor booking app. It's not an online pharmacy. It's not a supplement store. **It's a complete health management system** — consultation, prescription, medication, delivery, monitoring, and adjustment, all under one roof, running on a monthly subscription.

## How is this different from what already exists in India?

Let me paint the picture of what's out there today and why none of it does what we do.

**The doctor-booking apps** like Practo let you find a doctor, book a slot, and have a video call. That's it. The consultation ends, and you're on your own to find a pharmacy, buy medicines, remember refills, and figure out if the treatment is working. The platform doesn't know or care what happens after the call. They make money from the booking, not from your health outcome.

**The online pharmacies** like PharmEasy, 1mg, and Netmeds are essentially delivery apps for medicines. You upload a prescription, they deliver pills. They compete on discounts — 15% off, 20% off. There's no doctor on their end designing a treatment for you. There's no monitoring. There's no follow-up. And their margins are razor-thin (16-25%) because anyone can undercut them with a bigger discount. That's why PharmEasy's valuation crashed over 90% — the model doesn't create loyalty.

**The D2C wellness brands** like Man Matters, Bold Care, and Be Bodywise sell branded supplements and wellness products. They offer free consultations, but the consultation is really just a funnel to sell you a bottle of ashwagandha or a hair serum. Most of their products are nutritional supplements, not prescription medicines. They're selling SKUs, not managing your condition. Half their customers stop buying within a year because there's no clinical relationship holding them.

**The hospital apps** like Apollo 24/7 have the infrastructure — thousands of pharmacies, thousands of doctors — but they exist to funnel you into their hospital system. They're not building a consumer brand around managing your specific condition with personalized protocols and beautiful products delivered to your door.

Here's what nobody in India is doing: **owning the entire journey from diagnosis to delivery to ongoing care, for stigmatized conditions, with branded prescription medications, on a subscription that keeps you healthy month after month.** That's the gap. That's what we fill.

## Why will this work specifically in India?

Five reasons, each one massive.

**First, stigma is the market.** 70% of Indian men won't discuss sexual health problems with anyone — not a doctor, not their partner, not a friend. One in five Indian women has PCOS, but fewer than 30% are clinically diagnosed because women don't seek help for hormonal issues due to shame and cultural barriers. 140 million women will go through menopause, mostly suffering in silence. These aren't niche problems. These are enormous populations who desperately need help but won't walk into a clinic. A private, phone-based platform where you never have to say an embarrassing word out loud to another human being — that's not a convenience feature. **That's the only way millions of Indians will ever access treatment at all.**

**Second, the timing on weight loss drugs is perfect.** Semaglutide — the most effective weight loss medication ever created — has its patent expiring in India in March 2026. Right now it costs ₹17,000 a month. When 15+ generic manufacturers launch their versions, the price crashes to ₹3,000-5,000 a month. Suddenly, effective medical weight loss becomes affordable for India's urban middle class. One in four Indians aged 15-49 is overweight. 101 million are diabetic. 135 million are pre-diabetic. And nobody has built a clinical platform specifically to manage these patients with the new affordable medications. We will be there when this wave hits.

**Third, India's pharmaceutical manufacturing ecosystem is the best in the world for this model.** India is the pharmacy of the world — we have hundreds of contract manufacturers who can produce custom-branded tablets with specific colors, shapes, coatings, embossing, and packaging at incredibly low costs. Creating beautifully designed, branded medications isn't science fiction in India — it's a phone call to a CDMO in Baddi or Hyderabad. Minimum order quantities start at 5,000-10,000 units per SKU. The entire infrastructure exists. Nobody in the D2C health space has thought to use it for prescription clinical products with premium branding.

**Fourth, the doctor shortage makes telehealth essential, not optional.** India has 1 doctor for every 1,511 people. 75% of doctors are concentrated in cities. 86% of rural medical visits require traveling long distances. The Telemedicine Practice Guidelines of 2020 legally permit doctors to prescribe Schedule H drugs (which covers all our target medications — sildenafil, tadalafil, finasteride, semaglutide, metformin, spironolactone) via video or even chat consultations. A doctor in Mumbai can legally treat a patient in a village in Bihar. The legal framework is in place. The infrastructure (smartphones, WhatsApp, UPI) is in place. 523 million Indians use WhatsApp. What's missing is a platform that puts it all together into a clinical system.

**Fifth, Indians are ready to pay for subscription health.** The D2C brands have already proven this — Man Matters runs over 1 lakh free consultations a month and converts them to product subscriptions at a 60% repeat rate. Mosaic Wellness grew to ₹749 crore in revenue in just five years. Bold Care became the #1 sexual wellness brand on quick commerce. The consumer behavior is validated. What hasn't been built yet is a subscription model for actual clinical care with prescription medications and ongoing doctor monitoring — which is a fundamentally stickier, higher-value, higher-retention model.

## What do users get?

**Privacy above everything.** Your consultation happens on your phone. Your medicines arrive in unmarked, beautifully designed packaging — no medical labels visible from the outside, nothing that would tell your family, roommate, or delivery person what's inside. No awkward pharmacy counter conversations.

**Real doctors, real prescriptions.** Not chatbots pretending to be doctors. Not "wellness coaches" recommending supplements. Licensed RMP doctors, specialists in urology, gynecology, endocrinology, and dermatology, reviewing your case and prescribing FDA-equivalent medications under India's Telemedicine Practice Guidelines.

**Personalized treatment, not one-size-fits-all.** Your treatment plan is built for your specific condition, your body, your medical history. If standard doses don't work, your doctor adjusts. If you need combination therapy, it's designed specifically for you.

**Continuous care, not one-off visits.** Your doctor doesn't disappear after the first consultation. They monitor your progress, check in on side effects, adjust medications as needed. Lab tests are coordinated when required. This is what clinical care is supposed to look like — ongoing management, not a single transaction.

**Affordable monthly pricing.** Instead of paying ₹500-1,000 per doctor visit plus unpredictable medicine costs, you pay one predictable monthly fee that covers consultation, medication, delivery, and monitoring. Annual plans bring the cost down further. No surprises.

**Medications that don't look like "medications."** Beautifully designed products with premium packaging that you'd be comfortable having on your nightstand. This isn't about vanity — when people feel good about their treatment, they stick with it, and adherence is the #1 factor in whether a treatment actually works.

## What do doctors get?

**Predictable, steady income.** Instead of waiting for patients to walk through the door, doctors on our platform receive a consistent flow of subscription patients requiring regular consultations. The platform handles scheduling, payment collection, and patient acquisition — doctors just practice medicine.

**Reduced administrative burden.** Our proprietary EMR (electronic medical records) system auto-generates clinical notes, flags patient risks, tracks treatment adherence, and manages prescription renewals. Doctors spend time on clinical decisions, not paperwork.

**Flexibility to practice from anywhere.** A dermatologist in Chennai can manage patients across 15 states from their living room. Part-time doctors — retired specialists, doctors on maternity leave, physicians in small towns — can build meaningful practices without geographic constraints.

**Better patient data than they've ever had.** Because we control the pharmacy, we know exactly whether patients are filling their prescriptions, taking their medicines, and reporting outcomes. Most doctors in India prescribe and then have no visibility into adherence. Our platform gives them real-time treatment data.

**Clinical protocols and decision support.** AI-powered treatment recommendation engines, trained on thousands of patient outcomes, help doctors identify optimal medications, dosages, and combinations — especially valuable for complex conditions like PCOS where multi-specialist coordination is needed.

## What do pharmacies get?

**100% prescription capture with zero acquisition cost.** Every consultation that generates a prescription flows directly to our pharmacy partner or captive pharmacy. No marketing spend, no patient acquisition cost, no competing on discounts.

**Higher margins through branded formulations.** Instead of selling generic medicines at thin 16-22% retail margins, our pharmacy fulfills branded, custom-formulated products with 50-70% gross margins. The brand premium is built into the subscription price, not squeezed out of the pharmacy's margin.

**Predictable demand through subscriptions.** Subscription models mean the pharmacy knows exactly how many units of each medication will be needed next month. This eliminates waste from expired stock, enables bulk procurement at better prices, and allows precise staffing and inventory management.

**Growth path to own manufacturing.** Starting as fulfillment partners, pharmacies gain access to our patient volume and data. The most capable partners can evolve into private-label manufacturing partners, producing custom formulations under our brand — a far more lucrative business than retail dispensing.

## What do labs get?

**Consistent B2B test order volume without marketing.** A subscription clinical model generates regular testing requirements — baseline blood panels at enrollment, quarterly monitoring (liver function, hormone levels, metabolic markers, HbA1c for diabetic patients on GLP-1 medications). This creates predictable, recurring B2B revenue for diagnostic partners at negotiated rates.

**Patient acquisition without spending a rupee.** Labs typically spend significant money on consumer marketing to drive walk-in test bookings. Our platform sends patients directly to partner labs with specific test orders already generated by the treating physician. The lab focuses on what it does best — running tests — while we handle everything else.

**Home collection integration.** Our platform integrates lab home collection services into the care journey seamlessly. The patient doesn't need to find a lab, compare prices, or figure out which tests they need. The doctor orders the tests, the platform triggers the booking, and a phlebotomist shows up at the patient's door.

## What does our future look like?

**Phase 1 (Now → Year 2): Build the clinical engine.** We launch with ED, PCOS, and weight loss — three conditions with massive unmet demand, high stigma, proven subscription economics, and medications that are legally prescribable via telemedicine. We partner with existing pharmacies for fulfillment and contract manufacturers for branded products. We prove the model works in Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore.

**Phase 2 (Year 2-3): Own the supply chain.** We obtain our own pharmacy license (₹5-20 lakhs, straightforward process) and begin fulfilling prescriptions directly. We develop 20-30 private-label SKUs through loan-license agreements with contract manufacturers — custom-branded tablets, topical solutions, chewable medications, and combination formulations designed specifically for Indian patients. Gross margins jump from 55% to 65-70%.

**Phase 3 (Year 3-4): Become a manufacturing brand.** We establish our own GMP manufacturing facility or acquire a small manufacturer. We produce our own beautifully designed tablets, chewables, topical sprays, and possibly injectable administration kits (for GLP-1 medications). Custom colors, shapes, embossing, premium packaging — all in-house. We control quality from molecule to doorstep. Gross margins reach 75%+.

**Phase 4 (Year 4-5): Become a health intelligence company.** By this point, we have clinical data from hundreds of thousands of patients — real treatment outcomes, adherence patterns, genetic and demographic correlations, medication efficacy data segmented by Indian population groups. This data powers an AI engine that gets smarter with every patient, recommending optimal treatments with increasing precision. We integrate wearable data (continuous glucose monitors, smartwatches, blood pressure devices) to shift from reactive medicine to proactive health management. We know when a patient's glucose patterns are deteriorating before they feel symptoms and trigger an automatic doctor review.

**Phase 5 (Year 5+): India's clinical health brand.** We're not a telehealth platform anymore. We're not a pharmacy. We're not a D2C brand. We're the trusted name that millions of Indians associate with taking control of their health — privately, affordably, and effectively. When someone in Lucknow realizes they're losing their hair, they don't Google "hair loss treatment" — they come to us. When a woman in Pune gets a PCOS diagnosis, her first instinct is to subscribe to our care plan. When generic semaglutide makes medical weight loss mainstream, we're the brand that manages that journey from first dose to goal weight to maintenance.

The B2B channel opens simultaneously — corporate wellness programs where employers offer our platform as an employee benefit (anonymous access to ED, PCOS, weight management, and mental health care). India's ₹2 billion corporate wellness market is growing fast, and employers are desperate for solutions that actually improve outcomes rather than just checking a benefits box.

International expansion follows — UAE and Saudi Arabia first (high smartphone penetration, cultural stigma driving demand for discreet digital healthcare, clear regulatory frameworks, high per-capita income), then Southeast Asia.

## The bottom line, in the simplest possible terms

Everyone else in India is selling pieces of healthcare — a doctor visit here, a medicine delivery there, a supplement bottle somewhere else. **We're building the whole thing.** Doctor, prescription, custom medication, delivery, monitoring, adjustment — all in one subscription, all in your phone, all in discreet packaging that respects your privacy.

That's why customers stay. That's why margins are high. That's why competitors can't easily copy it. And that's why this becomes not just a business, but a brand that changes how 1.4 billion people think about taking care of themselves.
